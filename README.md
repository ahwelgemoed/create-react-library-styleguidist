## How This Works

Create A custom, React Component Lib from with Docs - Based Off create-react-library and Added React Styleguidist

How To RUN

yarn

cd example and run `yarn start`

in root run `yarn start`

in root run `yarn styleguide`

This is Split into 3 Sections

Components -

Documents -

Example -

In 'tm/src/components/\*\*' build the components (Export All in index.js)

Add a 'Filename.md' to make it appear in the styleguide Docs

In 'tm/example/\*\*' is a normal CRA Here imports Components to views and play with / can be seen as tests but test must also be written

TODO
